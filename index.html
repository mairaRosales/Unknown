                <p><strong>Nikumaroro Island</strong><br><br> The pilot Amelia Earhart disappeared while attempting to fly around the world with her navigator, Fred Noonan in 1937. The pair radioed that they were out of gas and disappeared without a trace. Although many believe they perished after crashing into the ocean others believe she was taken prisoner by the Japanese. <br><br> One of the most credible theories is that Earhart and Noonan crashed on Gardner Island, now known as Nikumaroro Island. Possible evidence includes unidentified bones discovered on the uninhabited island.</p>

                <p><strong>Great Blue Hole, Belize</strong><br><br>This underwater sinkhole is over 400 feet deep and 984 feet from one side to the other and home to creatures like sharks and giant grouper. For years, no one was sure what was at the bottom of the Great Blue Hole. <br><br> Recent expeditions have allowed cameras into deeper waters than were previously possible, allowing scientists to get a glimpse of icicle-shaped shaped mineral formations and mysterious, unidentified tracks at the floor of the hole. Hopefully, future expeditions will be able to tell us what kind of creature made them.</p>

                <p><strong>Skull Chapel, Czerma</strong><br><br>It was created between 1776-1804 when the local parish priest by accident found a mass grave. For the following 20 years, he with a local grave digger collected human remains that didn’t have proper graves. The walls of this extraordinary chapel are covered with 3 thousand tightly arranged human skulls and bones. <br><br>The remnants of the people who were victims of wars and epidemics which were their direct result. In the crypt under the chapel there are about 20-30 thousand remnants more. The main aim of the chapel is to commemorate war victims and also to caution contemporary people against the atrocities of war. It is the only such chapel in Poland and only 1 of 3 in Europe.</p>

                <p> <strong>Easter Island, Chile</strong><br><br>Otherwise known by its original name of <em>Rapa Nui</em> is one of the most remote places on Earth. It’s located 2,300 miles from South America and 1,100 miles from the nearest island. Yet somehow, ancient people managed to build more than 1,000 heavy Moai statues there.<br><br> Scientists and archeologists still don’t know why the statues were erected in such a remote location, how they moved the heavy stones, or what happened to the people who built them and seemingly abandoned the island. Rapa Nui is one of the cities you learned about in school that no longer exist.</p>
